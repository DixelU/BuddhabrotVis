# BuddhabrotVis
**Monte-carlo method-based buddhabrot fractal drawer**

You can:
  
  * Manipulate with fields on the left.
  * Move "camera" by using WASD.  
  * Scale UI (and therefore field) by pressing **up** and **down** arrows.
  * Negate brightness by pressing 'n'
  * Pause by pressing space.

Warning: **keyboard manipulations are sensitive to case and language** *that's not my problem, that's freeglut's one*
